# Auto Layout Image Display

## Project Description

"Auto Background Image Display" is a simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript project that dynamically displays a collection of background images within a flexible container. The project utilizes flexbox to create an organized layout that adjusts to different screen sizes.

## Styles

The CSS styles define a container with the class "my-sign" that uses flex properties for flexible layout and responsiveness. Background images are applied to child div elements with the class "background-image." The background-size property is set to "contain" to ensure that the background images maintain their aspect ratio and fit within the specified dimensions.
